  * Remove obs-api.cron.d since the tasks triggered are now handled by the
    app itself.
  * Depend on ruby-sanitize 3.0.0 since the Sanitize::Config::merge method
    is needed.
  * Move apache Passenger configuration inside vhost so it doesn't apply
    globally.
  * Set apache Passenger user to www-data to match apache itself and
    obsapidelayed. This simplifies permission handling.
  * Make secret.key and database.yml only writable by root and only
    readable by www-data group.
  * Don't create unused log files in obs-api.postinst.
  * Set correct log file ownership in obs-api.postinst.
  * Rotate clockworkd.clock.output file with other obs-api logs.
  * Set secure permissions for production.sphinx.conf since database
    credentials are copied there from database.yml.
  * Make obs-api data directories writable in postinst by www-data like in
    rake-tasks.sh. The latter is not run automatically.
  * Remove duplicate apache configuration lines.
  * Remove apache ssl_request_log CustomLog using nonexistent ssl_combined
    LogFormat nickname.
  * Use combined LogFormat for apache access.
  * Set apache PassengerLogFile to /var/log/obs/passenger.log so they're
    not sent to the global apache error log.
  * Always update Gemfile.lock after installation. If the system ruby
    modules have changed, then the app will refuse to start. Always update
    Gemfile.lock in the postinst and add a trigger so it's run whenever
    ruby modules are updated.
  * Actually apply fix-sphinx.patch. This was added in 2.7.1-2 but wasn't
    actually in the series file. That means that the obs-api package still
    has a directory actually named "sphinx{,/production}".
  * Purge db_migrate.log file since rake-tasks.sh generates it on DB
    migrations.
